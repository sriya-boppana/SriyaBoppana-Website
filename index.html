        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Sriya Boppana and Iâ€™m an undergraduate student at the University of Riverside. My major is Pre-Business and I planning a concentration in marketing.  I strongly believe that my work experience in conceptualizing, planning, and event execution as well as my flexibility and communication skills will allow me to succeed in any role. Some experience Iâ€™ve had was in my Virtual Enterprise program at my high school in which I took on the role of Chief Executive Officer and lead my peers in completing a business proposal that was ranked in the top 21 in the western region of VE. Furthermore, I learned a lot from my time in the program with working and planning events. To raise money, I proactively came up with a plan to hold a school fundraiser and with quick adapting along the way, we were able to completely sell out and generate over $570 in less than an hour. I also helped plan a business conference to be held at Portola High School to prepare future Virtual Enterprise students by creating mock testing material and coordinating with the school on the schedule and reserving classrooms to make it happen.
<br><br>

        As an intern at a direct marketing company, Iâ€™ve spent every day interacting with 80+ potential customers and Iâ€™ve learned how to create a good first impression with a consistent sales pitch and adapted my approach to people in a way that would maximize their experience. I also gained leadership experience when I became a team leader to train newcomers about the systems and procedures we use and was able to see their confidence and skills grow over time. Iâ€™ve also been part of the floor staff at a local Regal movie theater and after going through hours of in-depth training, I was very much equipped to answer any questions that any of our guests had, and was able to escalate the matter to a team leader or manager when needed. And as a public library volunteer, my responsibilities included shelving and organizing collections, and also helping drive their summer reading program by encouraging sign-ups. 
<br><br>

        As a producer on my high schoolâ€™s broadcast team, I created and pitched segment ideas on a weekly basis, and once approved, would efficiently create plans for the pre-production, shoot, and editing of the project in a timely manner. This included getting all the necessary people, props, and locations prepared and ensuring that the final product is edited to broadcast exactly as planned in order to contribute to the impactful content that our show strived to create for the student body. Iâ€™ve also been part of the floor staff at a local Regal movie theater and after going through hours of in-depth training, I was very much equipped to answer any questions that any of our guests had, and was able to escalate the matter to a team leader or manager when needed. During my shifts, Iâ€™d also often be in charge of picking up any calls that our theater received and answering those accordingly. Additionally, I consistently contributed to promoting the Regal Unlimited Program to guests and was able to see our teamâ€™s growth over time.
